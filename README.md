## Requirement Gathering
- Helm chart to deploy a sample application to a Kubernetes cluster
- Single Helm Chart to deploy all components to a desired namespace with best production practises.
- Database deployment integration and considerations.

## SPRINT 1: Choosing an application with backend logic and database and manual deployment for image verification and understanding the variables.
I have chosen to use the stocks application developed by CloudAcademy. This application is a stock data management system designed to handle and store stock market data using a Spring Boot backend and a MySQL database. It provides a RESTful API for CRUD operations on stock data.

- Completed running the containers manually with docker-compose and the application is working as expected on localhost. Faced errors related to mysql connection failure , did troubleshooting using
  `docker logs containerid`
